<h2><em>1. In Cold Blood by Truman Capote</em></h2>

<div class="blurb"><p>Arguably the book that launched the genre as we know it, Capote’s career-defining work begins with a shocking quadruple homicide in a quiet Kansas town. Though the case itself is open-and-shut, the author still manages to extract a spellbinding, psychologically rich story in the aftermath, based on interviews with the killers and exhaustive research on the victims. If you’re just starting to read true crime — or hoping to write it yourself one day — <em>In Cold Blood </em>is an unmissable introduction to the genre.</p></div>

<div class="blurb"><p>The Manson family murders were some of the most sensationalized killings of the 21st century. But how many of the rumors around them actually stemmed from reality? Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Manson in 1970, sets the record straight in this chilling yet mesmerizing account of his investigation, arrest, and conviction. (The title is taken from Manson’s notorious delusion of an imminent and destructive race war, which he dubbed “Helter Skelter.”)</p></div>

<h2><em>3. The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule</em></h2>

  <div class="blurb"><p>We wouldn’t leave the twisted tale of Ted Bundy off this list, and as a dedicated writer and one of Bundy’s closest friends, Ann Rule is uniquely qualified to tell it. She paints young Bundy as a fresh-faced college student, empathetic and kind, someone she would have trusted to care for her own children. They fell out of touch in 1974, and Rule soon heard reports of brutal murders carried out by a man matching Bundy’s description. Yet it took years for her to even admit the possibility of his involveent — a truth that clearly haunts her and colors her narration, lending this book incredible weight even as the prose remains crisp and readable.</p></div>

  <h2>4. Shot in the Heart by Mikal Gilmore</h2>

  </button>
<div class="blurb"><p>Remember <em>The Executioner’s Song</em>, number three on this list, which revolved around murderer Gary Gilmore and his wish to die? Take a look at the author’s surname here: Mikal is Gary’s younger brother. <em>Shot in the Heart</em> recounts their upbringing “inside the house where murder is born,” giving Gary’s offenses an eerie fatalistic ring and making clear that Mikal barely escaped a similar end. His unflinching descriptions of the family’s alcoholism and abuse are not easy to get through, but they do facilitate a more nuanced view of even the most dire criminals.</p></div><hr>

<div class="blurb"><p>O.J. Simpson’s infamous “trial of the century” has been rehashed innumerable times over the years, but never with such razor-sharp perception of absolutely every element in the case. Toobin, a Harvard-educated lawyer and high-level legal analyst, portrays both sides of the trial with total acuity and depth — demonstrating the utter exceptionality of what happened, while also unpacking the reasons why. If you’re remotely interested in criminal law, this one is a must-read (or a must-watch in the form of the Netflix adaptation, <em>The People v. O. J. Simpson</em>).</p></div>
